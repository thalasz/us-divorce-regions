##Analysis of U.S. divorce rates by region for 1990-2016.

A little exercise in data-wrangling with pandas with a small dataset.  Involved interpolating incomplete data, adding information scraped from Wikipedia and creating a pandas MultiIndex.

Inquiry inspired by a marriage (not my own, ahem) that lasted all of 30 days.
